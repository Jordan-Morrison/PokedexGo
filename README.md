# Pokedex Go
Pokedex Go is a fully featured Pokedex designed to make comparing Pokemon easy in Pokemon Go. The project is currently in beta, with desktop and native app support coming soon along with a bunch of other new features! This is my first major app, so if you find any bugs or have any feedback please let me know :)
## Supported Devices
As of now the following platforms are supported:
```

Android
```
Pokedex Go will be recieving **desktop** and **native app** support soon. Although the current state of the app is a web app, navigating to the site via desktop may result in formatting errors. For full performace please access the app via your mobile device.
## Installation
Please visit [Pokedex Go](https://jordan-morrison.github.io/PokedexGo/) on your mobile device and add the shortcut to your home screen. Pokedex Go is setup as a web app and will install itself when the shortcut is added.

## Acknowledgements
This project was created to help Pokemon Go players analyze their Pokemon. Absolutely no revenue is being made from Pokedex Go, it is made for Pokemon Go players to enjoy as well as a learning experience for myself as I'm studying mobile development. I do not own any of the rights to Pokemon or Niantic Labs. If you are a owner of any of the content used within Pokedex Go and wish for it to be removed from Pokedex Go please just let me know and I will not hesitate to remove the content, or the entire project if necessary.
