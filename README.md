# Pokedex Go
Pokedex Go is a fully featured Pokedex designed to make comparing Pokemon easy in Pokemon Go. The project is currently in beta, with desktop and native app support coming soon along with a bunch of other new features! This is my first major app, so if you find any bugs or have any feedback please let me know :)
## What's New in Version 2.0
The long awaited native support for Android is finally here! Checkout the installation section below to get the APK!
You'll also notice that the sprites are now directly from Pokemon Go, a new news system and minor text fixes ;)
## Supported Devices
As of now the following platforms are supported:
```
iOS,
Android
```
Pokedex Go will be recieving **desktop** support soon. Although the current state of the app is a web app, navigating to the site via desktop may result in formatting errors. For full performace please access the app via your mobile device.
## Installation
### Android
If you're running Android then your best bet is to install the **native** verion of Pokedex Go.
You can download the APK [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jordan-Morrison/PokedexGo/master/Pokedex%20Go.apk).

If you're uncomfortable installing an APK from the internet then you can access Pokedex Go as a web site, or even better the web app! Just visit [Pokedex Go](https://jordan-morrison.github.io/PokedexGo/) on your phone and if you'd like, add the shortcut to your home screen. If you're having issues installing the web app I've posted a tutorial here:

### iOS
Please visit [Pokedex Go](https://jordan-morrison.github.io/PokedexGo/) on your mobile device and add the shortcut to your home screen. Pokedex Go is setup as a web app and will install itself when the shortcut is added.

If you're unfamiliar with adding apps to your home screen from the browser then you can follow the following tutorial:

I do currently have a working native version for iOS, however have no way of distributing it. Apple does not allow installation of apps from sources other than the App Store. There are a few ways of code sigining ipa files such as [iOS App Signer](https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/) or jailbreaking, however these methods are considered un-safe by some and are often patched quite quickly. If you know a way to distribute the app (for free) then please let me know :) I can also post an unsigned ipa for those interested in installing with a jailbreak or other code signing service.

## Planned Features
The following are just some of the planned features for Pokedex Go.
```
Desktop support,
Swipe gesture support to switch/open/close menus,
Shinies, forms and genders,
Sorting options (Attack, Defense, HP, CP, etc)
More search options (shiny, types, moves etc)
And much more!
```
