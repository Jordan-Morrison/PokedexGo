Stats in Pokemon Go are formulated directly from the main series games, so by using these formulas we can very accurately predict the stats of upcoming Pokemon. Be aware that these stats can change, as weâ€™ve seen strong Pokemon such as Mewtwo receive a nerf.</p><p style='padding: 0 15px;'>One thing we cannot accurately predict is moves, so all of the generation 4 Pokemon have no moves to compare (moves will be updated when we start to see them in the game master). You can still however compare stats and cross your fingers for good movesets!</p></div><div style=' color: white; text-shadow: 0 0 20px #9e0b0b; border: solid; background: #FFAFBD; background: linear-gradient(to right, #ffc3a0, #FFAFBD); padding-bottom: 20px;'> <h1 style=' text-align: center; padding-top: 10px; font-size: 2rem;'>Mew's moves have been updated!</h1> <p style=' padding: 0 15px;'>Research is live in Pokemon Go, and so is Mew!
